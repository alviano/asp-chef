The **Meta Supported Models** operation extends models in input with some encoded meta programming encoding.

The meta encoding can be used to compute supported models of a reified program (see the **Reify Program** operation).

The definitions are base64 encoded and wrapped by predicate `__base64__`.

The name of the unary predicate `__base64__` can be specified in the recipe.
