The **@config/Register Javascript** operation adds operations to the local storage of the browser.

New operations can be fetched from a remote URL, from multiple remote URLs stored in a given predicate, or from Base64-encoded terms. The code must adhere to the **Javascript** operation (providing name and doc).

HackMD and GitHub URLs are rewritten to their public counterparts. The input is forwarded to the next ingredient.

**Important!** Button REGISTER must be clicked. The new operations are available in the **Operations** panel after a refresh or after modifying the filter, also for other recipes.

Note that this operation is intended as a way to configure and customize ASP Chef. **It is strongly suggested to register new operations only on recently loaded pages, so that the list of registered operations is aligned to the local storage of the browser.**
