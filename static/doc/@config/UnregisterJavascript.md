The **@config/Unregister Javascript** operation removes operations from the local storage of the browser.

**Important!** Button UNREGISTER or UNREGISTER ALL must be clicked. The **Operations** panel is updated after a refresh or after modifying the filter, also for other recipes.

Note that this operation is intended as a way to configure and customize ASP Chef. **It is strongly suggested to unregister operations only on recently loaded pages, so that the list of registered operations is aligned to the local storage of the browser.**
