The **Unique** operation removes each model that is preceded by another copy of the model.

Each model is compared with previous models and provided in output only if it is unique. A list of predicates can be ignored.

Note that order of elements in models does matter, that is, models with the same elements but in different orders will be considered different models. A **Sort Canonical** operation can be used to make the ordering immaterial.
