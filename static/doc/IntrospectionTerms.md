The **Introspection Terms** operation extends models in input with some encoded Lua content.

The definitions are base64 encoded and wrapped by predicate `__base64__`.

The name of the unary predicate `__base64__` can be specified in the recipe. Also the name of the @-terms defined by this can be customized.
