The **@dumbo/Template Documentation** operation provides access to the documentation of all core templates (@dumbo/*).

It is possible to control the height of the ingredient, and to filter the templates so to find the one of interest.

The (Markdown) documentation can be saved in facts to be later passed to LLMs or other operations.
