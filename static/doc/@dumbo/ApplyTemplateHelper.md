The **@dumbo/Apply Template Helper** operation provides an assistant to apply core templates (@dumbo/*).

The predicates of the selected template can be renamed using the UI of the ingredient, and the fact to apply the template is Base64-encoded the specified output predicate.

The output of this operation can be later used by **@dumbo/Expand Templates** or other ingredients.
Alternatively, the output can be copied in the clipboard and pasted in an **Encode** ingredient (to be subsequently expanded using **@dumbo/Expand Template**).
