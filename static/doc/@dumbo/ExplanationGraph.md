The **@dumbo/Explanation Graph** operation computes an explanation graph for the program stored in `__program__`, the answer set stored in `__answer_set__`, the Herbrand base stored in `__herbrand_base__`, and the query atoms stored in `__query__`.

The result is stored in predicate`__herbrand_base__`. Atoms with predicate `__false__` are excluded from the base.
