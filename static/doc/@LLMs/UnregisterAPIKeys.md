The **@LLMs/Unregister API Keys** operation gives the possibility to unregister API keys used to access servers providing LLMs services.

Servers associated with API keys saved in the local storage are listed.
They can be unregistered selectively, or in bulk.

It is also possible to disable all API keys (they will be removed from the session storage).
