The **Recipe** operation takes a URL representing another recipe and adds that recipe as an ingredient.

This operation is practically equivalent to copy all ingredients of a recipe into another recipe.

Note that ASP Chef URLs also contains input, as well as flags to encode input and decode output.
Such content is ignored, as well as anything preceding `#`.

The ingredients of the recipe ingredient can be added to the main recipe (explode button). Similarly, some ingredients can be imploded into the recipe ingredient (implode button), actually replacing it.
