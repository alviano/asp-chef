The **Union** operation replaces each model in input with a sequence of _brave consequences_.

A unary predicate is decoded as part of the program (default `__base64__/1`).

Each model in input is used as the input of a program given in the recipe, and its brave consequences are computed. _Weak constraints should not be included in the program; use the **Optimize** operation._
